# web-development-portfolio

## Description

This project represents the start of collating my work as a web developer. The goal was to create a representation of my skills so far, and this is achieved through showcasing projects and using colour/layout/typography that best represents my personal image.

This is the first draft of what I hope to be a detailed portfolio of the work I undertake as a web developer.
